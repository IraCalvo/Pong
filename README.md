# Pong
Class Game

this class game is the classic Pong game. Unfortunately this game does not have an AI that controls the 2nd paddle, but it it playabble with another player as the
both paddles are controllable. This game helped reinforced movement of objects within a scene based on the collision it goes through, which is what allows the ball
the keep bouncing until a point is scored.
